Continuous Sprinkles
====================

Continuous Sprinkles is a [Sprinkle](https://github.com/crafterm/sprinkle) recipe to setup a Jenkins CI server for Ruby development. It provides:

* Jenkins
* Git
* Apache proxy to Jenkins
* MySQL
* Postgres
* Redis
* Mongodb
* Ruby
* RVM
* IPtables rules

Usage
-----

You need to install Sprinkle:

    gem install sprinkle

Check out the Continuous Sprinkles repository, copy the config.example.rb to config.rb, and edit config.rb to use your CI's host name:

    HOST = 'ci.mydomain.com'

 Then cd into the checked out Continuous Sprinkles repository, and run:

    sprinkle -s main.rb

It will use capistrano to SSH into your CI host and install all necessary dependencies. The script will take a while to run.
